 <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
 
 <h3>About this game</h3>
 
 <p class="bonus">This game includes 4 cards for you to test your memory, 2 queens (queen of hearts and queen of diamonds) and 2 kings (king of hearts and king of diamonds). It is up to you to find a match of queen with queen and king with king by flipping 2 cards at a time. If the 2 cards match you won! If the cards do not match please refresh the page and try again. You can do it!</p>
 
 <h4>A little about me:</h4>
 
 <p class="bonus">I have discovered my passion for web development recently, in my past life I was a biotechnology engineer, researcher, project manager and regulatory affairs specialist. With my new passion I wanted to merge the worlds and offer something else to the web development world! I hope in the near future to create a game that will help study biology topics by combining concept with it definition. How cool would it be if while studying molecular biology you can test yourself during playing a game? I think it will be great!!!!
